# StudentsResults
This is a website that accepts the number of students in the class, and for each student, accepts their Exams score, Assessment score and Fees paid. It then prints out, for each student, whether he or she has passed, was condoned or failed. It also tells whether he or she was granted certificate.

1. Requirement for passing an exam is that, student must pass the exam by a score of 25 or more and must also pass the assessment by 15 or more to get a certificate.  
2. If a student score a total grade of 39 for both grading component(i.e. if only a student score exam 25 and assessment 14 totalling 39, or exam 24 and assessment 15 totalling 39), the student is condoned.  
3. If a student satisfy both Req. 1 or Req. 2 and have paid their fees in full(where fee is 100), they are issued with a certificate.  
4. A student is deemed to have failed if he/she does not meet Req. 1 or Req. 2.
